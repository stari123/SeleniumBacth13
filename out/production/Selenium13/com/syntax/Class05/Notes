Selenium Class 5

Handling checkboxes and radiobuttons:
-- if you only have 1 checkbox or 1 radiobutton -- you can just click on it
-- if you have multiple choices - store them in a List and loop through

DropDowns
DropDowns is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

Types of DropDowns:
1. Single Select
2. Multiple Select

Handling dropdowns:
1. click on dropdowns and click on option
2. using Select Class
                in order to use Select Class
                we need to make sure our dropdown has
                a Select tag

Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
1. by index
2. by visible text
3. by value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them inside
the container such as List, Set etc..

In order to deselect the option from dropdown
-- Make sure your DD is multiple select
deselectByValue()
deselectByIndex()
deselectByVisibleText()
deselectAll()
