Selenium Class 10

Calendars
Calendars are also called as date-pickers

How to Handle Calendar:
1. Click on the calendar
2. locate the month and get text
3. if the desired text is not visible --> we will keep clicking on next and keep updating month text
4. as soon as we find our desired text --> grab all the cells from the table
5. loop through the cells
6. once the cell value is matched with our condition --> click on the matched date

Why do we need screenshots in testing?
in testing it is very important to take screenshots in order to prove that our tests
covered certain functionality

in selenium in order to take screenshot we will be using
"TakesScreenshot interface"
