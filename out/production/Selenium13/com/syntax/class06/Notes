Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are on.
We cannot proceed further until it is handled.

3 types of Alerts:
1. Web Based alerts/ HTML Alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions.
2. Javascript Alert/ browser alert - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                     we cannot inspect
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium - it is  not windows OS, it is a window window.

4. Autentication Alert- we can not use alert interface for this, but send username and password.
    public static String url = "https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth";
                                         //username:password@

Types of JS alerts:
1. simple alert - click ok
2. confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click on cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()



Frames:
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page


3 ways to interact or to switch to a frame
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by webelement

in alerts - switch to an alert manually and switch back automatically
in frames - switch to frame manually and switch back to the main page manually
