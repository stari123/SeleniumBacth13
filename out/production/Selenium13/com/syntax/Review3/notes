***************Selenium Review 03****************

--->checkboxes


-->single select dropdown

if it has a select we can use select  class from selenium and select any desired option by 3 different ways

1.selectByIndex
2.selectByvalue
3.SelectByVisibleText


Steps to deal with DD:
1.insepct the dropDown , does it has a select tag? if yes then procedd with step 2
2.write down the locator (xpath,css) to get this particular drop down in selenium
3.create an object of the select class and pass in the "webelement select" as parameter
4.use select class to make selection of the desired option


difference in mutli select and single select
1.in multi select we have options of deselect
2.in multiselect we can select more then one value at a time


---------------------Alerts---------------
popup that takes the control off the screen and moves the focus on alert
we need to handle the aleet in order to proceed with automation!!!!!
types of alerts:
1.html alerts/Webbased  --> we can insepct them and deal with them in a regular manner
2.javaScript/browser alert-->we can handle them using selenium by switching to them and then either accepting or declining them
3.windowbased alert --> we cant handle them using selenium
